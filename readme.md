# About

A Rust port of the MaxMatrix Library for Arduino Development

I ported this library from the C++ version. Credits go to [riyas-org max7219 library](https://github.com/riyas-org/max7219)

# Installation

This Rust library has to be used with the [Arduino Hal](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) for Rust.

Add this to your Cargo.toml file:
```toml
maxmatrix_rs = { git = "https://github.com/JB-it/maxmatrix_rs"}
```

## Warning

This library is still under development and will not build at the moment.

I will update the readme once I figured out why..
