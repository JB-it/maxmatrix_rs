# About

A Rust port of the MaxMatrix Library for Arduino Development

I ported this library from the C++ version. Credits go to [riyas-org max7219 library](https://github.com/riyas-org/max7219)

# Installation

This Rust library has to be used with the [Arduino Hal](https://github.com/Rahix/avr-hal-template) for Rust.

```toml
maxmatrix_rs = 0.1.2
```
